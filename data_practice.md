## 1st practice: 
- Data: Adult
- Comment:
    - Algorithm: could see difference when using Decision tree and Naive Bayes in the learning curve. others like lr, or svm, there are no much change in when changing the parameter; 
    - Practice: try to plot the same curve as the paper mentioned, which is the accuracy change with the increase of the instance quantity. But could not plot the same as the paper does. 

## 2nd pracitce: 
- Data: Mushroom/ http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom
- Purpose: 
    1. to see the prediction's accuracy
    2. to see the main feature to decide which mushroom could be eaten
